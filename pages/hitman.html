    <h2>Hitman</h2>
    <p>
      Hitman is a stealth video game franchise created by IO Interactive. In
      each installment, players assume the role of a cloned contract killer
      named Agent 47, who travels around the world to assassinate various
      targets that are assigned to him by the fictional International Contract
      Agency (ICA). Gameplay focuses on freedom of approach, with most levels
      placing the player in a large sandbox location where they have free rein
      to explore and find different ways to reach and eliminate their targets.
      Stealth is a major component of the gameplay and players are given various
      tools to accomplish their objectives, such as suppressed weaponry and the
      ability to take disguises, which allow 47 to blend in with non-player
      characters (NPCs) and bypass most restricted areas undetected.
