    <h2>Red Dead Redemption 2</h2>
    <p>
      Red Dead Redemption 2 is a 2018 action-adventure game developed and
      published by Rockstar Games. The game is the third entry in the Red Dead
      series and a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption. The story is
      set in a fictionalized representation of the United States in 1899 and
      follows the exploits of Arthur Morgan, an outlaw and member of the Van der
      Linde gang, who must deal with the decline of the Wild West whilst
      attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other
      adversaries. The game is presented through first- and third-person
      perspectives, and the player may freely roam in its interactive open
      world. Gameplay elements include shootouts, robberies, hunting, horseback
      riding, interacting with non-player characters, and maintaining the
      character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. A bounty system
      governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes
      committed by the player.
