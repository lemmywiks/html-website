    <h2>Grand Theft Auto 5</h2>
    <p>
      Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar
      North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the seventh main entry in the
      Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and the
      fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San
      Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows
      three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster
      Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips—and their
      attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government
      agency and powerful criminals. The open world design lets players freely
      roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos,
      based on Los Angeles.
